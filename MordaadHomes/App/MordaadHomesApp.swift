// Iâ€™m going to add a swipe category on top of the explore view and make it like a homeadvisor app, where there are categories of the projects, like custom build, renovation, plumbing, HVAC, air duct cleaning and general contractor like swiping horizontal cells, then when you choose a category, the exploreView gets updated with relevant listings. Make necessary changes in the app, in terms of architecture, UI, models and views to apply that shift
